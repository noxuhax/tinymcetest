# TinyMCE AdvCode Demo

This is a minimal Vite app that mounts TinyMCE with the premium **Advanced Code**
plugin enabled. Both `tinymce` and `tinymce-premium` are installed from npm, and
the license key field is intentionally left blank so you can supply your own.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the HTTPS localhost URL shown in the terminal. The dev server uses
`vite-plugin-mkcert` to generate a local certificate on first run, so your
browser may prompt you to trust it the first time you visit the site.
