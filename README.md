# TinyMCE AdvCode Demo

This is a minimal Vite app that mounts TinyMCE with the premium **Advanced Code**
plugin enabled. Both `tinymce` and `tinymce-premium` are installed from npm, and
the license key field is intentionally left blank so you can supply your own.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the localhost URL shown in the terminal.
